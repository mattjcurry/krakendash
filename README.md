Come hang out with us on freenode in #kraken-dashboard

## Installation and Roadmap

### Prerequisites:

The ceph-rest-api must be run on either a member of your Ceph cluster, or on a installed client node that has admin access to the cluster.


### Installation:

Create a new user called kraken then:
```
  cd /home/kraken
  git clone https://github.com/krakendash/krakendash
```

Install Kraken's dependencies:
```
apt-get install python-pip python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In the krakendash/contrib directory there are two files, api.sh and django.sh

```
cp krakendash/contrib/*.sh .
```

api.sh starts the ceph-rest-api in a screen session called api
django.sh starts krakendash in a screen session called django

You can run these files to kick off the api and application. To detach a screen session, use CTRL-A, then his the D key.

Now you can run Kraken!

in /home/kraken do:
./api.sh (if you are running kraken on a ceph client or cluster node)
./django.sh
  
  
Edit krakendash/kraken/kraken/settings.py

Here you can change CEPH_BASE_URL to point at your host running ceph-rest-api, it is preconfigured already for localhost.
